Lab: Getting started with GitHub

Estimated time: 30 minutes

In this lab, you will get started with GitHub by creating a GitHub account and project. You will then add a file to the project using the GitHub web interface.

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Describe GitHub
Create a GitHub account
Add a project/repository
Create and edit a file
Upload and commit a file
GitHub overview
Before we learn to use GitHub, let’s first review Git. Git is an open-source version-control system for software development. It is simply a place where you can collect all your folders and files for a project. This collection of folders and files is usually called a repository.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its features. While Git is a command-line tool and you also need to host and maintain a server using the command line, GitHub provides the Git server for you, as well as a web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools, for every project.

GitHub provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process. GitHub includes a free plan for individual developers and for hosting open-source projects.

1. Creating a GitHub account
To create an account in GitHub, complete the following steps:

Go to the Join GitHub page and create an account. Note: If you already have a GitHub account, log in now.

Provide the necessary details to create an account as shown below. When you have finished, click Create account.

2: Add a project / repository
To add a new repository, complete the following steps:

At the top right of the GitHub home page, click on the “+” icon and select New repository.

Click Create repository. The repository is created and its home page is displayed.

Next, you’ll start editing the repository.

3: Create and edit a file
Edit a file

Although you will normally create a file before you edit it, in this case, the README.md file has already been created for you. To edit that file, complete the following steps:

Your repository root folder contains just one file: README.md. Click the pencil icon at the right to edit the file.

Add some text to the file.

Scroll to the bottom of the file and click Commit changes.

Confirm that the text you added to the file has been saved.

Create a new file

Click on the repository name to go back to the main branch, similar to this repository called testrepo.

Click Add file and select Create new file to create a new file in the repository.

Enter a file name and extension; for example, firstpython.py. Add the lines of code displayed in the following image to your file:

image

Scroll to the bottom of the page. You can optionally add a description of your update (for example, “Adding a new file”). Click Commit to create your new file.

Your file is now added to your repository and the repository listing shows when the file was added or last revised.

4. Upload and commit a file
To upload a local file and commit it to your repository, complete the following steps:

On your repository page, click Add file and then select Upload files to upload a file.

image

Click choose your files and choose a file from your computer. You can upload any file (for example, a .txt, .ipynb, or .png file) to the repository.

image

When the file finishes uploading, click Commit changes.

image

Your file is uploaded to the repository.

Summary
Congratulations! In this lab, you have learned how to create a new repository, add a new file, edit a file, upload a file, and commit your changes. We encourage you to continue to update your repository to become familiar with the processes that you have learned.
